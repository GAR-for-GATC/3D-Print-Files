<font size="6">Peg Sample Board</font>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The peg sample board was made to find the correct size hole and peg that would optimally fit together when printed 
using the FlashForge 3D printer.  This was needed because the accuracy of the printer and degree of thermal expansion
of the ABS plastic were not experimentally known.  The results were written down and are shown below.  The results of this 
were used to make the IC holder tower.

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to measure the width and depth of square and circular pegs and holes made by a "FlashForge"
3D printer.  The material used was Makerbot White ABS plastic.  The designs were made in Inventor and were increased by 1000
in the makerbot desktop application before being sent to the printer itself.  The pegs and holes had a diameter of 5.0mm and 
varied by .1mm to a diameter of 5.9mm.  All hole depths were 3.5mm.  More details are shown below:

Atribute | Value             
------------------------|--------
Infill: | 15%
Number of shells: | 3
Layer Height: | 0.2mm
Nozzle Temp: | 240 °C
Baseplate Temp: | 110 °C
Nozzle Extrusion Speed: | 70 mm/sec

Results:

All Results are in mm.  Top shows the designed diameter of the pegs.  All other values show the actual measurements.
Measurements were taken using an iGaging digital caliper with a measurment tolerance of 0.001 inches and a depth measurement tolerance of 0.001 inches and a deviation of 0.0005.
