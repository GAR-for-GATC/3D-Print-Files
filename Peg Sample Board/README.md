<font size="6">Peg Sample Board</font>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The peg sample board was made to find the correct size hole and peg that would optimally fit together when printed 
using the FlashForge 3D printer.  This was needed because the accuracy of the printer and degree of thermal expansion
of the ABS plastic were not experimentally known.  The results were written down and are shown below.  The results of this 
were used to make the IC holder towre.
